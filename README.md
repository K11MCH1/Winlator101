# Winlator

Winlator is an Android application that lets you run Windows applications with Wine/Proton and Box86/Box64/Box32/FEXcore.  
(depending on the version)

# Compatibility list  

The [Issues page](https://github.com/K11MCH1/Winlator101/issues) contains a comprehensive repository documenting GitHub Issues related to Windows applications and their compatibility status with Winlator and its various forks. It tracks regressions and improvements in a title's functionalityâ€”ranging from `nothing` to  `crash` or fully `playable` based off the `soc` and `winlator version`â€”while incorporating metadata for efficient retesting. 
Given the fragmentation of Android devices and the variety of existing Winlator forks, compiling this list will be a thorough process requiring users to invest some time when submitting a post. The extensive nature of the compatibility database ensures accurate tracking across different setups, helping developers and users identify critical issues and optimize performance effectively.
