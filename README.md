# Compatibility list  

The [Issues page](https://github.com/K11MCH1/Winlator101/issues) contains a comprehensive repository documenting GitHub Issues related to Windows applications and their compatibility status with Winlator and its various forks. It tracks regressions and improvements in a title's functionalityâ€”ranging from `nothing` to  `crash` or fully `playable` based off the `soc` and `winlator version`â€”while incorporating metadata for efficient retesting. 
Given the fragmentation of Android devices and the variety of existing Winlator forks, compiling this list will be a thorough process requiring users to invest some time when submitting a post. The extensive nature of the compatibility database ensures accurate tracking across different setups, helping developers and users identify critical issues and optimize performance effectively.  

#### How do I contribute?
You can start contributing by checking if any title you want to test already has a [**issue**](https://github.com/K11MCH1/Winlator101/issues) by using the search feature:

</p>

* **If you can find one**: You can comment on the existing issue given what you see compatibility differs from the previous report.   
* **If you cannot find an existing report**: You can go ahead and [create an issue](https://github.com/K11MCH1/Winlator101/issues/new/choose) for it by filling all the details in the form.

#### Should I include a image/video?
As a general guideline, media should be included when it is useful to do so and provides information that cannot be conveyed via text, these guidelines serve as a rough idea of why they may be important in certain circumstances and not in others. Additionally, any media captured **must** be a direct screen capture rather than an external recording using another phone or a camera. If it is impossible to do so due to the nature of the bug, this can be ignored but generally it shouldn't be.
* **Crash**: A photo/video is generally useless in the case of a crash as the log *should* contain the crash, it may not in certain cases and we can request them in a further comment and in those cases the guidelines of a **Freeze** can be utilized.
* **Freeze**: A video is generally useful to fully understand what the bug is and in this case it should be included, it is important to show Performance Statistics by having DXVK_HUD, GALLIUM_HUD, MANGO_HUD, mesa hud or the Winlator HUD enabled in this case as it helps to determine the exact point of the freeze.
* **Auditory Glitch**: A video is useful when there are random dropouts in audio or if it doesn't sound correct, an exception is when the game is not playing any audio at all in which case there is no need to upload a image/video.
* **Visual Bug/Glitch**: At minimum, a photo is required here when the glitching is persistent. A video is useful if the glitch is very visually diverse or pops in occassionally rather than being persistent.
