# THE CONTROLS EDITOR

The **Controls Editor** in Winlator allows users to map keys for the overlay layout, enabling a customized input experience.

- **Key Mapping Interface**: Users can assign specific keys to on-screen controls.
- **Custom Layouts**: The editor provides options to adjust the position, size, and transparency of overlay buttons.
- **Gamepad, Keyboard & Mouse Support**: Users can configure both physical controllers and touch-based inputs.

Note: Gamepad mode currently does not work.

As seen on the picture above, tapping anywhere on the grid will moves the crosshair to that position.

The plus button adds an empty keyless button on the grid.

By tapping and holding the new button, it can be moved to another position.


When a button is selected, it will turn blue after which you can either delete or edit with the 2nd and 3rd buttons respectively shown above.

After tapping the cogwheel, an editor will open up.  
You can edit your button and give it a:

### **Custom text**  
This is bugged. The text only appears after closing the editor.

### Toggle Switch

The 'Toggle Switch' turns the button into a "repeater button". If this is on and toggled in game, Winlator will continue sending out the keystroke until toggled off.
