Your device may automatically scan the APK file for viruses and malware and could potentially block the installation if it deems the file suspicious. If this occurs, you may need to override the restriction by selecting an option such as 'Install Anyway' or 'Ignore.'  
Sometimes disabling the Protection System may be necessary to continue.
