The "Contents" menu in Winlator forks like Winlator Cmod is a feature that allows users to manage and install various components such as Custom Box, DXVK, Turnip, Wine, and more. This menu was originally implemented by Longjunyu, and it provides users with greater flexibility in configuring their Winlator environment.

These wcp files are essentially compressed archives that contain pre-configured settings and dependencies, making it easier for users to install and manage different versions of Wine and other essential tools.

## Creating .wcp files  

The process of creating a wcp file typically involves extracting the necessary files, updating prefixes, compressing them into a `tar.xz` archive, and then renaming it to .wcp. This format simplifies installation and ensures compatibility with different configurations in Winlator glib.
