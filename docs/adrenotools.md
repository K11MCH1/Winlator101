The Adrenotools GPU Drivers menu allows users to install Adreno GPU drivers for improved performance and compatibility. This menu allows the installation of different driver versions, including Mesa Turnip drivers and Qualcomm drivers.  

These drivers need to be Adrenotools compatible packaged in `.zip` and not be packaged for Magisk or systemwide installation such TWRP packages.

## GPU quirks & compatibility  

Certain GPU driver limitations still apply within this environment. For instance, Snapdragon 8 Elite GPU drivers are not backward compatible with older Adreno GPUs. Similarly, Meta Quest drivers may not function properly on Adreno 7xx GPUs, potentially requiring a special compatibility patch to ensure proper operation.
